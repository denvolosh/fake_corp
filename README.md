*	All	the	employees	at	Fake	Corp	keep	a	record	of	how	many	hours	

they	work	a	week.	Management	would	like	to	know	who	is	working	

more	than	the	required	hours	in	any	one	week.

*	The	provided	CSV	file	(fake_corp.csv)	lists	all	the	employees	of	Fake	

Corp	and	the	hours	they	have	worked	in	the	last	4	weeks.

*	Write	a	Ruby	script	to	find	all	of	the	employees	who	worked	more	

than	the	required	number	of	hours	in	any	given	week.	All	employees	

are	contracted	to	work	7	hours	a	day,	5	days	a	week.

*	Your	script	should	produce	a	text	file	containing	a	list	of	employees	

who	have	worked	more	time	than	required,	sorted	alphabetically	by	

their	last	name.
